# Password-Generator

## Description

With all the apps and website a person has to sign up for, a password is necesary and creating one that is secure becomes hard as the more webistes and apps a person signs up for so I wanted to create a sense of security for the user; to do that I created a password generator. I think this will help a user feel secure about their passwords and help them make their login as secure as possible.

## Usage

To use this webiste it is fairly simple, all a user has to do is follow the link and enter the website and from there a red button with the generate password will be displayed. The user with click the button and will be presented with a variety of options on how they want the password to be. After all the options have been selected the user will be prompt with their randomly generated password.
